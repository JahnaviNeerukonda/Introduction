-SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is the principal tool for administering the Database Engine and writing Transact-SQL code.
It's hosted in the Visual Studio shell. SSMS is available as a free download. 
The latest version can be used with older versions of the Database Engine.

-SQL Server Configuration Manager installs with both SQL Server and the client tools. 
It lets you enable server protocols, configure protocol options such as TCP ports, configure server services to start automatically, and configure client computers to connect in your preferred manner. 
This tool configures the more advanced connectivity elements but doesn't enable features.

To connect to the Database Engine :
-At least one administrator account was selected when SQL Server was being installed. Perform the following step while logged into Windows as an administrator.
-In Management Studio, on the File menu, select Connect Object Explorer.
-The Connect to Server dialog box opens. The Server type box displays the type of component that was last used.
-Select Database Engine.
-In the Server name box, type the name of the instance of the Database Engine. 
 For the default instance of SQL Server, the server name is the computer name.
 For a named instance of SQL Server, the server name is the <computer_name>\<instance_name>, such as ACCTG_SRVR\SQLEXPRESS. 
 The following screenshot shows connecting to the default (unnamed) instance of SQL Server on a computer named PracticeComputer. 
 The user logged into Windows is Mary from the Contoso domain. When using Windows Authentication, you cannot change the user name.
-Select Connect.
